There are so many remasters of Dark Side of the Moon and the last few vinyl releases dont sound as good as the HD Tracks version because the digital version came from the master tape when it was in better shape says Katz. Thought with technology and the way vinyl has come on plus this being a 2017 remaster that id order it and see if had improved.

<p>This only really applies where the original source before the digital remastering was in an analog format. Dead quiet between tracks centered center hole and beautifully adhered labels to the Lps themselves no annoying tears by the holeat least not on any of my copies.

All in all I prefer the vinyl to the remastered cd. Pin On Products.</p>
