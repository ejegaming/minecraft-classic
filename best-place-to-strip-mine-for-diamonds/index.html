<p><strong>Best Place To Strip Mine For Diamonds</strong>, However strip mining is no longer the best method of finding diamonds in Minecraft 117. Previously the best level to find diamonds was at Y level 12 but that has changed now. These were the new changes made to the Ore Distribution in Minecraft by the 118 Update.</p>

<p>Players have found that the best level to strip mine for diamonds before the Caves and Cliffs update was Y-level 12 but with the additional 60 levels added to the worlds depth that has changed. I would recommend to strip mine at y11 this is because it is above lava and you can find any ores at this level. With the introduction of new Minecraft cave generations a new type of mega cave is the best source of diamonds.</p>
<h3 id="these-were-the-new-changes-made-to-the-ore-distribution-in-minecraft-by-the-118-update">These were the new changes made to the Ore Distribution in Minecraft by the 118 Update.</h3><p>There was no variety in block height aside from the much newer copper which was more likely to be found. The best level to find diamonds in Minecraft 118 is the Y-Level -59. Its worth noting that you can still find redstone lapis lazuli iron and gold at these levels but. However you are more likely to run into lava lakes. Redstone shares a similar ore generation as Diamonds.</p>
