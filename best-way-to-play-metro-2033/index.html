<p><strong>Best Way To Play Metro 2033</strong>, Both Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light are good but if you directly start playing the Metro Last Light you will most probably not get what happened in the background and whats going next so its good to play the Metro 2033 before starting this game.

<h3 id="i-played-metro">I played Metro.</h3><p>Both Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light are good but if you directly start playing the Metro Last Light you will most probably not get what happened in the background and whats going next so its good to play the Metro 2033 before starting this game. The engaging narrative amazing level of detail and entertaining gameplay combine to make this a bit special. Metro 2033 uses a system which automatically heals the main character after hes been injured and this works great for most of the easier fights however it wont be an effective method for difficult battles. This is the true way the original non-redux Metro 2033 was meant to be played. The based game is the first game of arguably the best first-person shooter series Metro with a decent story becomes even better with the unique atmosphere.</p>
