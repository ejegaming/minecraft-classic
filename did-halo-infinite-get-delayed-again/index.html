<p>Recently Microsoft and 343 Industries announced that Halo Infinite has been delayed to 2021 due to developmental challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Halo Infinite to reportedly receive new features due to delay This game is going to change everything when its out By Surej Singh 22nd. Xbox did not confirm a new release window other than next year for Halo Infinite explaining that the delay comes as the result of multiple factors that have contributed to development challenges. Halo is Xboxs most important franchise and so it makes sense for the company to go all out to ensure that the next game in the series Halo Infinite lives up to expectations and avoids the pitfalls. Halo 4 Halo 5 and The Master Chief Collection all failed to perform as well with critics as past games and the latter suffered from severe technical issues for years.

<p>According to a Microsoft insider Halo Infinite could get delayed until 2022 and no longer feature Xbox One support so it could launch exclusively for the Xbox Series X and PC. Halo Infinite takes place on Zeta Halo otherwise known as Installation 07. Although the games current launch window of Holiday 2021 seems to be locked in 343. Microsofts first party studios were an embarrassing failure during the Xbox one years. I did express in the other topic that no co-op is kinda sty but tbh I dont think its a dealbreaker either.

<p>Halo is Xboxs most important franchise and so it makes sense for the company to go all out to ensure that the next game in the series Halo Infinite lives up to expectations and avoids the pitfalls. Halo infinite didnt look like it was going to reach the decent threshold even if it did launch this year. December 9 2020 Halo Infinite Officially Delayed to Fall 2021 With the announcement that Halo Infinite has been delayed until sometime late in 2021 Microsoft has seemingly ended the year in. Infinite now delayed into 2021 and without even a firm date in 2021 a lot of the early appeal for the Series X is gone. Games were the major struggle of the previous-gen for Microsoft.
