<p>Updated 08272021 1054 AM. This is because the developer behind the game Zenimax Online Studios has not made ESO cross-platform between PC and Xbox One.

Further the game hosts separate servers for each platform meaning youll only ever run into players that are on the same system as you are. Elder Scrolls Online Eso Cross Platform Guide Mmosumo.</p>

<p>This is because the developer behind the game Zenimax Online Studios has not made ESO cross-platform between PC and Xbox One. Currently 139 XBox One games are supporting cross-platform play.
