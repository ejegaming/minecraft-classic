<p>FreeCodeCamp is ideal if you already know some code because you can simple skim through it and still understand it. I have heard best things about FreeCodeCamp and quite bad things about CodeCademy - As it is apprently to hand holding and doesnt give you the skills to go away set up a dev environment and create somehting. We designed it this way so that everyone - regardless of where they live how busy they are or how much money they have - can become a professional developer if theyre serious. FreeCodeCamp is a donor-supported tax-exempt 501c3 nonprofit organization United States Federal Tax Identification Number. I think I am about to finish the course in 3 year time I guess.
