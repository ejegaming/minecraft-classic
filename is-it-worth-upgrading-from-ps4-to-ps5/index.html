Now that I have a PS5 I want to play the DLC but cant decide if I should get the Directors Cut PS4 or PS5 version. Although the PS5 is upgraded from the PS4 Pro in almost every way the upgrade weve enjoyed most is switching from HDD to SSD. Its a brand new machine using cutting edge technology whereas the PS4 Pro was built upon. If you have exhausted all the PS4 games and want to play games like Demon Soul on PS5 with the best graphical performance it makes sense to upgrade. Ps5 Vs Ps4 Should You Upgrade Radio Times.</p>

<p>That being said going forward PS5 upgrades for in-house PS4 games will cost 10. However if you can do get yourself a PS5 within the next year or two. If you already have a PS4 Pro the PS5 is worth saving up for and upgrading to. Now that I have a PS5 I want to play the DLC but cant decide if I should get the Directors Cut PS4 or PS5 version.

<p>I was stunned at how. But you really arent missing out on much by waiting on a PS5. The main difference appears to be in the resolution which is lower on the PS4PS4 Pro than the PS5. Yeahits definitely worth it and also god of war ragnorok is also releases in 2021. Get an external hard drive for all your ps4 games and an internal for the ps5 down the line if you really need one but theyre honestly very worth it ive had mine since day release and im yet to regret buying it 2 level 1 GN0K 2 mo.

How long will PS4 be supported. Yeahits definitely worth it and also god of war ragnorok is also releases in 2021. Ps4 Vs Ps5 Should You Upgrade What Hi Fi.</p>
