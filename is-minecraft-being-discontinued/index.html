<p>PlayStation 4 Edition is the Legacy Console Edition version of Minecraft developed by 4J Studios and Mojang Studios for the PlayStation 4. So yesterday we got told some very sad news regarding the Minecraft Pocket Edition Comunity Mojang by the end of 2020 will no longer be supporting a range. Probably the most interesting ones on this list are 76162 Black Widows Helicopter Chase which is leaving shelves only six months after the heavily-delayed movie arrived in cinemas and 76165 Iron Man Helmet which is the first Marvel. Minecraft fans were recently thrown into panic mode by reports that the server would be shutting down in December 2020 making this the final year for the games block-based communities to thrive. Existing Java users will need to make the mandatory transition in early 2021. Another Minecraft Game Rules On Bottom Of Page Minecraft Cards Minecraft Party.</p>
