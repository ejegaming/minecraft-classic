<p><strong>Is The Reme Halo Led Safe</strong>, The HALO-LED proactively treats every cubic inch of air conditioned space reducing airborne and surface contaminants and pollutants through bi-polar ionization and revolutionary patent pending REME-LED technology. The amount of ozone is deemed safe by US. During the Bipolar Ionisation purification process REME HALO ionises the air by electrically charging the surrounding and air molecules.</p>

Hydrosonolysis Halo Led Better Indoors From betterindoors.com</p>
<p>Health officials but its still something to consider. The HALO-LED proacvely treats every cubic inch of air-condioned space thereby reducing airborne and surface microbials bacteria viruses mold smoke and VOCs. These negatively charged molecules bond with the positively charged particles like dust dirt dander germs and smoke.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-a-strong-oxidizing-agent">It is a strong oxidizing agent.</h3><p>The latest addition to this unit is an LED bulb with a longer life and warranty. This higher output also drops more particulates from the air bringing relief to those who suffer from allergies and other respiratory issues. Before now Reme Halo units in general its been people complaining about their eyes bothering them feeling poor and aggravated respiratory systems etc. The REME HALO-LED by RGF is designed to eliminate sick building syndrome risks by reducing odors air pollutants VOCs Chemical Odors smoke mold bacteria and viruses. But it normally depends on how much a unit is creating in the air you breathe and Im not sure how much the LED model does.</p>
