<p>Its lost its meaning in the comics but it hasnt in Young Justice. What Happened Whats Next. Throughout all of those adventures the lingering presence of the late Wally West Kid Flash cast a shadow over the entire series.</p>
<h3 id="it-was-here-that-wally-apparently-died-while-running-at-top-speed-his-body-seemingly-vaporized">It was here that Wally apparently died while running at top speed his body seemingly vaporized.</h3><p>He died at the end of the Invasion arc in Season 2 when his essence dissipated while stopping bombs set up by the Light and the Reach. What Happened Whats Next. After the initial victory of the Team against the Light he quit being a hero and pursued a normal life with Artemis but when their help was needed he once again assumed the role of a hero and died while helping The Flash and Impulse save the world. Wally also came out of retirement in the season 2 finale in order to help destroy an alien doomsday device that would have destroyed all life on Earth. If the Speed Force exists on Earth-16 then no one in that universe knows about it.</p>
