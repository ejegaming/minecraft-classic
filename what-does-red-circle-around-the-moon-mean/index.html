<p>APOD Halos are caused by the light of the sun or moon passing through a very thin layer of cirruform ice-crystal clouds in the upper atmosphere. The ice crystals refract the light of the moon similar to the way water droplets in the lower atmosphere can refract sunlight to produce a rainbow. The ring or a lunar halo is caused by the refraction and reflection of light from ice crystals that are suspended in thin wispy cirrus or cirrostratus clouds that are at high altitudes. The prism effect of light passing through these six-sided ice crystals separates the light into its various colors resulting in a halo tinged with very pale rainbow colors with red on the inside and blue on the outside. The folklore depicting that the ring formed around the Moon at night is due to Wolfs howling. Pin On Moon.</p>
