Have Scientists Really Found Something Harder Than Diamond From theconversation.com</p>
<p>Scientists have calculated that wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite hexagonal diamond both have greater indentation strengths than diamond. That is over 7 more incompressible than diamond but it is never found pure enough in nature to challenge the diamond. What is the hardest rock besides diamond.</p>
<h3 id="because-diamond-is-an-insulator-rather-than-a-conductor-of-electricity-it-is-not-classified-as-a-metal">Because diamond is an insulator rather than a conductor of electricity it is not classified as a metal.</h3><p>Scientists have calculated that wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite hexagonal diamond both have greater indentation strengths than diamond. Synthetic diamond can exist as a single continuous crystal or as small polycrystals interconnected through the grain boundaries. Which is the hardest rock. This is a boon for cutting if done properly. Diamond is the hardest mineral as it is the most difficult to break or cut.</p>
