<p>Why did Bungie stop making Halo. Some time in some year that I dont remember Bungie decided they wanted to be independent again. Microsoft Contracted Bungie to create the halo series but they never had the right to Halo.</p>
<h3 id="however-ms-needed-a-killer-game-for-their-new-xbox-back-in-2001">However MS needed a killer game for their new Xbox back in 2001.</h3><p>Theysold Halo to Microsoft in 19992000-ish and thats why itsan Xbox Exclusive. Of course Microsoft wont do that and the series will either remain fine or be destroyed my 343 microsoft. In 2007 they signed their separation fromMicrosoft but Microsoft still owns Halo so they assigned343 to make their games since Bungie became independent butsoon signed with Activision. Microsoft owns Halo and everything related to Halo. As of February 2021 Bungie will be officially done with the Halo franchise once and for all.</p>

<p>Why did Halo 4 fail. Bungie had a 10 year contract w Microsoft. CE is a First-person shooter science-fiction video game created by Bungie Studios which was a subsidiary of Microsoft Game Studios at that time. Halo 4 was too much like Call of Duty and not enough of its own thing as Halo should be and thats why it failed. Bungie hasnt made a new Halo game since 2010s Halo.

<p>As Halo was owned directly by Microsoft they created a sub-brunch now known as 343 Industries which is directly part of Microsoft. The subsidiary that would eventually become 343 came into the picture near the end of Halo 3s development and began the slow transfer of responsibility of the IP over to Frankie and Bonnie Ross. Bungie hasnt made a new Halo game since 2010s Halo. The company then went on to make Destiny which has been a loved game for a long time now. I believe one of the reasons they stopped developing Halo is because Bungie wanted to move on from the Halo series and create another game.
