<p>I start the game and nothing happens. Its not out yet. The contents of the Expansion pass include two major DLC coming. The third game Metro Exodus successfully brings its lengthy single-player campaign to the post-apocalyptic surface without sacrificing any of the series signature tension. Were very happy to announce the Expansion Pass roadmap for Metro Exodus. Xbox Game Pass Games List December Games Plus Every Game Currently Available For Xbox Consoles Eurogamer Net.</p>

<p>My names LeverShot748 I buy the xbox game pass to really only play 1 game that was Metro Exodus bought seasons pass because of it being on the game pass library or even the two previous but I digress I would really appreciate if Metro Exodus could go back in the game pass library if no contracts have ended Thank you -Levi Shuter. In an era where. After its release in February this year and the release of the vast Ranger Update a month afterwards we know fans have been excitedly waiting to hear more on whats coming for the DLC and were happy to finally share that with you. Maybe Im doing something wrong but when I click on DLC in Metro Exoduses main menu it takes me to the Microsoft store page for exodus with options to buy the DLC not install it. You can buy the game the expansion pass or just buy gold edition to get the complete game with all the DLC.
