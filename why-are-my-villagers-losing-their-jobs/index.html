<p>Heres how to change villager jobs. Can Villagers Change Profession. During the day Villagers come to their Job Sites. You can recruit villagers without any available housing but their mood will start dropping and they will eventually leave. Villager children are understandably more important than adult villagers so attacking or killing one causes you to lose 3 or 5 popularity points respectively.

<p>Villagers not losing their proffessions after their work station is broken So i have encountered this behaviour both in singleplayer and mulitplayer on 1144 when trying to reset the trades of the villager it simply would not do it anymore the work station was claimed by another villager and the first one was stuck with the proffession. Villagers now emit green particles when joining a village setting a home bed or acquiring a job siteprofession to match Bedrock Edition. I would set the time to 8000 the villager would go to the pillar walk away and then I would set the time to 8000 again so the villager would check again. It means they need a bed to some extent to keep their job but do not need it to get a new job. They cant access the other ones cause the villagers are above the stations.

<p>The world of Minecraft is the one that keeps on giving with plenty of things for players to uncover interact with and make their own fun out of. Why do my villagers keep losing their jobs. I would set the time to 8000 the villager would go to the pillar walk away and then I would set the time to 8000 again so the villager would check again. I ran into the same issue as you did when first getting into the Villager and Pillager update stuff. They need access to a workstation to refresh their trades and if they havent leveled up they lose their professions without access to a workstation.
