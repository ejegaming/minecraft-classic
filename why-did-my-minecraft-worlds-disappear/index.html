I know that the world was probably corrupted in some way since their folders are still in my minecraft folder. Hello Im looking for some help with a world that I have spent over 750 hours on over the past 10 months. Image 128739 Herobrine Minecraft Herobrine Sightings Minecraft Pictures.</p>

<p>For example for the last world that had disappeared I had saved and quit 4 times and it only disappeared when I saved and quit the 5th time. I looked in all the houses and there were none in them. After a few more minecraft days had past even more disappeared now there is only 1 left and it is kind of freaking me out. I am just baffled since this has never happened to me until the 116 update. Okay so i was playing Minecraft and my power suddenly went out. Oh Its Herobrine Wa Minecraft Pictures Minecraft Picture.</p>

<p>Animals and mobs in Minecraft have a habit of disappearing when youre not looking as exemplified in the sad story above. A world on my Minecraft Realm I have been playing on for a while now suddenly got rid of some saved chunks after leaving said Realm which I figured out after joining again a few hours later. To be clear i didnt press F1 i just accidently press reset option when i want to make my minecraft not as lag as much if you know please let me know right away VXChronicles - 6 years ago. That means that something damaged the data of the world making it unproccessable by the game. Go to application data and simply upload from your online back ups.
