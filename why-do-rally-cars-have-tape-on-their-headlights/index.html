<p>Have you noticed recently a huge explosion in the number of idiots you see driving around without their headlights on at night. Considering NASCAR tracks are already lit up the headlights are removed to reduce the weight on the stock car and allow more spacelighter weight. There are no working headlights or brake. Cars are covered with stickers. When I was younger this never happened but in recent years Ive been seeing it more and more to the point where I was on a dark highway the other night and I swear a full 5 percent of vehicles didnt have their headlights on.

<p>If its done in an x that person isnt worried about damage to the head light but the tape is there to keep the glass off the track. People dont want to smash their headlights but its a very rare occurence anyway. That way if you were a GT car and saw a while light youd know to get out of the way since the lmps are faster and not really competing against you. Tape helps prevent that. There are no working headlights or brake. Ever Wonder Why Race Cars Tape Headlights The Auto Sunday.</p>
