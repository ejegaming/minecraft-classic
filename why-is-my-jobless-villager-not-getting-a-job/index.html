<p>It is suggested that the bug is triggered by abruptly leaving a village too soon after you entered it either by quitting the world or by using a Nether portal. The only reason a villager wont take a work station is because either. Villagers who have made their first trade can claim a job site block only if the block is associated with their profession. Villagers will only convert professions during their. If you would like to get a Villagers Profession you can change I would recommend getting another Zombie Villager and curing it then breeding the two and their baby will grow up to have a profession that you can change but note-Once a Villager had been traded with he CAN NOT change his profession.
