<p>I prefer the Disney canon mostly because things arent as messy. This means that everything else is. Legends had 40 years worth of stories.</p>
<h3 id="this-means-that-everything-else-is">This means that everything else is.</h3><p>Overall Legends is better but it also has thirty-odd years of content to back it up and while it has higher peaks than Disney has at the moment it also has MUCH MUCH lower lows. The hype surrounding it was awesome - it was like the buildup to a new movie and the quality of the books were there to match it. How does it compare to The Last Jedi. However in Legends his life fares much better. There are many reasons the first is that legends.</p>

<p>The Phantom Menace Jar Jar Binks has been the focus of many harsh criticisms among fans. Jar Jars Fate in Legends Is WAY Better Than Canon. The new Canon has only had 3.

<p>Yes I dont get why everyone is hating on the new Canon because its content is terrible like youve had one movie of new content while the EU goes all the way back to when the first movie was released. In 2014 the Lucasfilm Story Group LSG took the decision to reclassify the combined G and C canons into a new identity called Star Wars Legends as the stories had become too complicated to manage - there were many retcons contradictions and the whole thing was a bit of a mess. Pretty much just Clone Wars 2003. Answer 1 of 4. I dont think 1 game is better than another I like both the games the same it just that you play these games at different times If you looking for a casual game that you can chill and relax in then you should play dokkan battle as it is a card game.

<p>Legends however had the Thrawn trilogy. Non-Canon - Basically the stuff which wasnt considered canon within the EU. People dedicated to furthering the lore of the universe tend to focus on the quality of the material. Not like thats hard.
