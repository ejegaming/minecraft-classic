<p>The best option is to kill the Nitwit because they are useless. Villagers will only convert professions during their working hours. If you can trade with the villager already then that means hes already claimed. Nitwits can not gain employment. At one point it was working and they were turning into untradable ones when I broke the profession block but then they randomly got stuck as a permanent one from one of the profession blocks in my base.

<p>Why wont my villagers take a job. All the other villagers have jobs and there are sufficient beds one for every villager and I put 3 in the house with the librarians one for each No matter where I put the lecturn the guy didnt get a job. Which are usless and I suggest you sacrifice to HeRoBrInE. They may have already been traded with they are picking a different job site block or they have not claimed a bedYou can count the number of villagers beds and job site blocks to determine which one it could be. The Nitwits spawn in green cloths which makes them easy to distinguish. 2 Reasons Why Villager Is Not Changing Profession In Minecraft West Games.</p>
