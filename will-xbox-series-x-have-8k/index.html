<p><strong>Will Xbox Series X Have 8k</strong>, The international chip shortage has had an adverse effect on console sales for Microsoft and Sony but not so much to prevent either. Picking up a new 8K or 4K 120Hz-capable display will theoretically leave you Xbox Series X-ready though its far from recommended in the current market. Specifically Microsoft indicates that Xbox Series X supports 4K at 60FPS with possibility of up to 120FPS including support for Variable Refresh Rate VRR and 8K capability This is achievable due to Xbox Series X s custom AMD Zen 2 chipset and custom GPU which utilizes AMD RDNA architecture and Spencer had more to say about the consoles graphics processing.</p>
